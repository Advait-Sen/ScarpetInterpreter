# Scarpet interpreter

## Explanation
Scarpet is a quick-to-run programming language, invented as a way to make Minecraft modifications more quickly
[(in a nutshell, see here for a better description)](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet).

Seeing its potential as more than just a cool and underused feature in a video game, I decided to take it and make it into
a tool for making easy APIs. The idea is that you add this package into your project, and can then use it as an API language,
as it is a scripting tool that can be used to do cool things with your API while using simple and easy-flowing syntax.

To be completely honest though, the main reason for this is the idea of a cool project which teaches me about how languages work.
