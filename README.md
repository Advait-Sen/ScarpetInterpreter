# Scarpet interpreter

## Explanation
Scarpet is a quick-to-run programming language, invented as a way to make Minecraft modifications more quickly
[(in a nutshell, see here for a better description)](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet).

Seeing its potential as more than just a cool and underused feature in a video game, I decided to take it and make it into
a tool for making easy APIs. The idea is that you add this package into your project, and can then use it as an API language,
as it is a scripting tool that can be used to do cool things with your API while using simple and easy-flowing syntax.

I initially had a MIT license, before reading more about it and realising the potential problems with my code being used in ways I don't want it to be.
I have therefore switched to the Mozilla Public License, as it allowed me greater freedom over what my code can be used for.
In general, please contact me privately if you want to use my code in something private; I will probably agree.
